### 1. Pros of using a Decorator pattern

- **Modularity and Flexibility:**
  - Defines separate functions for each topping.
  - Easy to add or remove toppings without modifying core logic.
  - Allows flexible and dynamic pizza creation.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Adding a new topping is simple with a new function.
  - Minimal changes needed for new toppings.

- **Use of Functional Programming:**
  - Leverages principles like higher-order functions and reduce method.
  - More declarative and concise.
  - Easier to understand and maintain.

- **Adherence to the Open/Closed Principle:**
  - Open for extension (easy to add new toppings).
  - Closed for modification (existing code doesn't change).

- **Improved Readability:**
  - More readable and easier to follow.
  - Separation of concerns and descriptive function names.

- **Better Abstraction:**
  - Abstracts topping application into a higher-order function.
  - Hides complexity, making high-level logic clearer.

- **Summary:**
  - Offers a flexible, extensible, and maintainable approach.
  - Adheres to design principles and patterns.
