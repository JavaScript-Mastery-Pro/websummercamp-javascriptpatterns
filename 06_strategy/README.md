### 1. Approach using normal Functions

**Pros:**

- Simple and straightforward.
- Easy to understand for simple use cases.

**Cons:**

- Not scalable for many strategies.
- Tight coupling between the client code and the specific strategies.
- Harder to manage and extend with new strategies or modify existing ones without changing the client code.

### 2. Approach using Object-Oriented Strategy Pattern

**Pros:**

- **Encapsulation**: Strategies are encapsulated within classes, making it easier to manage and extend.
- **Polymorphism**: Strategies can be swapped easily without modifying the client code.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new strategies by creating new classes that implement the strategy interface.
- **Reusability**: Strategies can be reused across different contexts.

**Cons:**

- **More boilerplate code**: Requires defining classes and methods, which can be verbose.
- **Slightly higher learning curve**: Understanding object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism is necessary.
- Potentially heavier in terms of memory and performance due to class instances.

### 3. Approach using Functional Strategy Pattern

**Pros:**

- **Conciseness**: Less boilerplate compared to the object-oriented approach.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.
- **Flexibility**: Strategies are simple functions, making them easy to manage and test.
- **Lightweight**: Functional approach can be more memory-efficient compared to creating class instances.

**Cons:**

- **Less encapsulation**: Strategies are not as encapsulated as in the object-oriented approach.
- **Potential for less structured code**: Without proper organization, it might become harder to manage as the number of strategies grows.
- **Lack of polymorphism**: Doesn't leverage traditional polymorphism, relying instead on function references.

### Which is Better

The choice between these approaches depends on the specific needs of your project:

- **For Simple and Small Projects**: Approach 1 (Function-based Strategy) might be sufficient due to its simplicity and ease of understanding.
- **For Larger, More Complex Projects**: Approach 2 (Object-Oriented Strategy Pattern) provides better scalability, maintainability, and reusability due to its encapsulation and polymorphism features.
- **For Projects Favoring Functional Programming**: Approach 3 (Functional Strategy Pattern) offers a balanced, concise, and flexible solution while staying within functional programming paradigms.

**Recommendation**: Generally, **Approach 3 (Functional Strategy Pattern)** can be considered a good middle ground, offering simplicity and flexibility without the verbosity of the object-oriented approach. However, for projects where strict encapsulation and reusability are paramount, **Approach 2 (Object-Oriented Strategy Pattern)** would be more suitable.
