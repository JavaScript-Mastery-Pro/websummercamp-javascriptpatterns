### Without using the Adapter Pattern
- **Tight Coupling:** Directly depends on services like Twilio and Nodemailer, making it less flexible.
- **Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Handles logic for multiple services, leading to multiple reasons for changes.
- **Testing Difficulty:** Hard to test without actual services, leading to complex and flaky tests.

### With the Adapter Pattern 
- **Decoupling:** Uses `NotificationAdapter` and subclasses (`EmailAdapter`, `SMSAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`) to separate logic from services, making the code more flexible.
- **Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Adherence:** Each adapter handles its own service logic, improving maintainability.
- **Easier Testing:** Adapters can be mocked, making tests more reliable and faster.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Adding a new service is simple with a new adapter class, without modifying existing code. The system can easily support more notification services.

### Summary
The adapter pattern leads to a more flexible, maintainable, and testable design.
