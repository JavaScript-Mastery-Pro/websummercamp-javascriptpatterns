### 1. Approach using Direct Implementation without Adapter Pattern

**Pros:**

- **Simplicity**: Direct and straightforward implementation.
- **No Overhead**: No need for additional abstraction layers or objects.

**Cons:**

- **Tight Coupling**: The `sendNotification` function is tightly coupled to specific notification services, making it harder to modify or extend.
- **Code Duplication**: Similar logic is repeated for each notification type.
- **Scalability Issues**: Adding a new notification service requires modifying the main `sendNotification` function, increasing complexity.
- **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle**: The main function has to manage the logic for different services.

### 2. Approach using Object-Oriented Adapter Pattern

**Pros:**

- **Decoupling**: The notification logic is decoupled from specific service implementations, making it easier to modify or extend.
- **Code Reusability**: Each adapter can be reused independently of the main function.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility, handling only its specific notification service.
- **Scalability**: Adding new notification services requires creating a new adapter class without modifying the main logic.

**Cons:**

- **Complexity**: Slightly more complex due to the introduction of multiple classes.
- **Overhead**: Additional abstraction layers might add a bit of overhead.

### 3. Approach using Functional Programming with Adapters

**Pros:**

- **Decoupling**: Similar to the object-oriented approach, the notification logic is decoupled from the specific service implementations.
- **Functional Style**: Functions are first-class citizens and can be passed around easily, making the code more flexible and reusable.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each adapter function has a single responsibility.
- **Scalability**: Adding new notification services is straightforward and does not require modifying the main logic.

**Cons:**

- **Complexity**: Slightly more complex due to the introduction of multiple functions.
- **Readability**: For developers more accustomed to object-oriented programming, the functional approach might be less intuitive.

### Which is Better

For a scalable and maintainable solution, **Approach 2 (Object-Oriented Adapter Pattern)** or **Approach 3 (Functional Programming with Adapters)** are generally better choices. They both decouple the notification logic from the specific implementations and allow for easier extension and maintenance. The choice between these two largely depends on whether the team prefers an object-oriented or functional programming style.

- **Choose Approach 2** if the team is more comfortable with object-oriented programming principles and the application benefits from class-based abstractions.
- **Choose Approach 3** if the team prefers functional programming and seeks the flexibility and reusability that come with using functions as first-class citizens.
