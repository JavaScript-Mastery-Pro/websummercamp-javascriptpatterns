### 1. Approach using Object Literal

**Pros:**

1. **Simplicity:** Object literals are straightforward and easy to understand.
2. **Declarative:** Role hierarchy is defined directly in the object structure.
3. **Minimalist:** It requires less boilerplate code.

**Cons:**

1. **Limited Abstraction:** It lacks clear separation of concerns. Logic and data are mixed, making it harder to maintain and extend.
2. **Mutability:** The role structure is mutable, which might lead to unintended changes.
3. **Recursive Functions:** The `getPermissions` and `displayRoleHierarchy` functions are recursive, potentially leading to stack overflow errors for deeply nested role hierarchies.

### 2. Approach using Class-based Composition

**Pros:**

1. **Encapsulation:** Roles are encapsulated within objects, providing a clear separation of concerns.
2. **Inheritance:** Utilizes object-oriented principles like inheritance to model role hierarchies.
3. **Readability:** Class methods like `getPermissions` and `display` provide clear and readable code.

**Cons:**

1. **Complexity:** The class-based approach introduces more complexity, especially for those unfamiliar with object-oriented concepts.
2. **Mutability:** Similar to Approach 1, it allows mutability which can lead to unintended changes.
3. **Potential Tight Coupling:** Depending on how it's implemented, there might be tight coupling between roles, which reduces flexibility.

### 3. Approach using Functional Programming Composition

**Pros:**

1. **Immutability:** Functions are pure, avoiding mutation of state and reducing unexpected behavior.
2. **Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns with functions for creating, modifying, and retrieving roles.
3. **Readability:** Functions are focused and concise, making the code easy to understand.

**Cons:**

1. **Complexity for Beginners:** Functional programming concepts like higher-order functions and immutability might be challenging for beginners.
2. **Less Familiarity:** Developers more accustomed to object-oriented programming might find this approach less intuitive.
3. **Performance Concerns:** Recursive functions like `getPermissions` might be less performant for deeply nested role hierarchies compared to iterative solutions.

### Which is Better

Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors like team expertise, project requirements, and scalability.

For a project where simplicity and flexibility are key, **Approach 3 (Functional Programming)** might be preferable due to its emphasis on immutability and modularity. It provides a good balance between abstraction and maintainability.

However, if the project requires strong encapsulation and a clear hierarchy, **Approach 2 (Class-based)** might be more suitable, especially if the team is familiar with object-oriented principles.

**Approach 1 (Object Literal)** could be suitable for small projects or prototypes where simplicity and quick implementation are prioritized, but it might become unwieldy as the project grows in complexity.

Overall, I'd suggest **Approach 2 (Class-based)** due to its emphasis on Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Readability, which can lead to more maintainable and scalable codebases in the long run.
