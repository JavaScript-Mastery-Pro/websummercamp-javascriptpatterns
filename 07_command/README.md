## With & Without the Command Pattern

### Structured Command Implementation
- **Problem.js:** Uses simple functions without a unified interface, leading to inconsistent command implementations.
- **Solution.js:** Introduces a Command interface with `execute()` and `undo()` methods, ensuring consistent and formalized command structure.

### Encapsulation and Modularity
- **Problem.js:** Handles commands through standalone functions, passing data directly as arguments.
- **Solution.js:** Uses concrete command classes (e.g., `DeductFundsCommand`, `CreditFundsCommand`) that encapsulate command data and logic, enhancing modularity and data integrity.

### Undo Functionality
- **Problem.js:** Attempts to handle undo with a separate function, which is less integrated and flexible.
- **Solution.js:** Implements an `undo()` method in command classes, allowing easy and integrated command reversal.

### Transaction Management
- **Problem.js:** Lacks a clear mechanism for managing complex transactions.
- **Solution.js:** Demonstrates structured transaction execution and rollback using `executeTransaction` and `rollbackTransaction` functions to handle arrays of command objects.
